# Abstract
Nowadays,  traditional  online  shopping  stores  having  some  problems  in  buying  for  the customers  like  delivery  of  counterfeit  products.  To  solve  this  problem,  this  system  is providing  a  different  way  of  interaction  with  the  customers  using  augmented  reality, which  is  also  user-friendly  system.  In  this applicationuser  can  see  things  before  buyingvirtually,using  AR  that  is  providing  a  live  view environment  on  flat  surface  using camera.  The applicationhasfour  products  and  user  is  able  to  see  the  product  in  to  the phone by just pointing the camera of the phone on to the ground and after finding the flat surface,  the  model  of  the  product  will  be  shown  to  the  user.  The  system givesmore information as well asmore deepexperiences to customers, by combination of physical environment  with ARmodels.  It  is  an  attractive  experience  viewing  a  product  in  AR environment  than  2d  environment.  As  we  designed  and  developed  our  models  in Autodesk  Maya  and  also  did  someadjustments  of  the  models  in  Adobe  Photoshop  and our  main  working  is  in  Unity  3D.  We  build  our  whole  app  in  Unity  3D  like  interfaces, scenes, developed AR environment for this application. In this applicationsome products like  pants,  ties,  shirts  and  shoes  are  available.  In  future  the  user  can  experience  by wearing  a  product  virtually  in  AR  environment.  This  will  include  more  value  to  this application.  The  users  will  point  the  camera  to  the  footthe  model  of  the  shoe  will  be shown on the foot virtually inthe mobile screen, it will look like the user have wear the shoe in to the foot.
